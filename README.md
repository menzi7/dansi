# Dansi Keyboard Layout

Dansi is a custom keyboard layout based on the **[Swerty keyboard layout](https://johanegustafsson.net/projects/swerty/)**, optimized for the Danish language. The design goal for the dansi layout is to retain as much as possible of the standard US layout (also known as the ANSI keyboard layout), while adding Æ, Ø, and Å from the standard Danish layout.
